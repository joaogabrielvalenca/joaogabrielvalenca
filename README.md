### <About Me 🙄>
👨‍👩‍👧😺 I live with my wife, her daughter, and a lovely cat with the most captivating eyes. Although not a fan of long touches, the cat is always close by. She's the best!

🎵 I believe everyone has a favorite form of art, and mine is undoubtedly music (even though I have a slight anime addiction 🤫). I've been passionate about music since childhood. It started with Brazilian music, then transitioned to new metal, classic rock, progressive, and many more genres that might surprise you. Currently, I'm into instrumental music. I think removing vocals allows instruments to reach their full potential. As someone who values feelings over lyrics, this new phase (which has been going on for about three or four years now) is truly special, and nothing beats a perfectly timed beat.

🎮 I'm a dedicated gaming enthusiast. Not only do I enjoy playing, but I also love watching competitive gaming in titles like Counter-Strike, Apex Legends, and Valorant (I wish I could understand Dota and LoL, but they remain a mystery to me). High-level competition is not only entertaining but also a rich source of knowledge. It brings back memories of my time as a competitive poker player.

🏚 I've moved from city to city 11 times and changed houses 23 times. I've also traveled to 11 different countries and lived in Dublin for 7 months. While you might assume I'm someone who loves to travel and explore new things, I'm quite the opposite. I LOVE staying at home and find it challenging to even go out to a bar with friends. Staying at home or at a family/friend's house is my preferred choice. That said, a job opportunity abroad would be fantastic! 😬
